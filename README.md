# DSA-Project
The project involves parsing data from a CSV file containing information about cars.
It uses various data structures, including AVL trees, hash tables, and singly linked lists, to organize and store car data efficiently.
The project reads and processes the CSV file, populating the data structures with relevant information.
Users can query and retrieve car information based on parameters like model year.
